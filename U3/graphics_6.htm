	how we create them, how they are done in ways to attract the<br>Huamn eye, 
	what techniques we can use when creating a digital<br>graphic, what software 
	is used to create digital graphics,<br>digital graphics are used in 
	advertisements to promote their<br>Businesses, creating movie posters or 
	book covers and roads signs<br>designed for road safety.</p>
<p>
	I had fun when it came to doing digital graphics and I use some<br>of my 
	talent when came to making some it digital graphics is<br>something I enjoy 
	doing the most it something I will still be doing<br>for myself when it 
	comes to doing digital graphics I plan to use<br>my knowledge from what I 
	learned from doing digital graphics either<br>thats art or doing it for an 
	advertisment.</p>
<p>
	I enjoy the course and I am proud of some of the things that I made<br>along 
	the way creating digital graphics one of those types of<br>things I enjoy as 
	a hobby and being inspired by others who do it</p>
<p>
	and inspires me to do the same when it comes to doing digital<br>graphics.</p>

<p>I do digital graphics of my own in my free time or come up with<br>something 
for my class hours the christmas poster was made with<br>very different images 
but the tree was made inkscape to put into<br>the letter which was something I 
did last year.</p>
<p>I hope in the near future when I done ICT media I will be making<br>some 
incredible projects for the future when Im done with what I<br>Achieved in my 
career in Media and college and with what I learned<br>when it comes to digital 
graphics that enjoy its something I will<br>continue to do when Im done college.</p>
