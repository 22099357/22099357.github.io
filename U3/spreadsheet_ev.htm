	evidence for my spreadsheetclasswork and<br>what assignments have been done 
	throughout the<br>year with progress that has been made when<br>working on 
	my assignments it wasn't easy to<br>work on this sort of work but I got some 
	of <br>them done with only some that were difficult to<br>do.</p>
<p>Though while it wasn't easy doing it I did<br>manage to get some of it done 
whe working on<br>Excel is really difficult to get this page will<br>provide the 
evidence of what I did and what<br>I've done and excel give opertunites when 
done<br>right.</p>
<p>This is my practice tasks and additonal
formatting work it wasn't easy but I managed it<br>when working on it as a 
practice task and due to<br>understanding some of the formaulas in which to<br>
calclate data was hard when using and is not<br>easy when using.</p>
