	Unit 6 Evidence<img alt="unit6" height="183" src="images/unit6classroom.jpg" style="float: right" width="264"></p>
<p>In this page this is where all of my evidence of work is<br>and is always 
linked from the digital graphics page<br>this evidence is what I have done over 
the past fewmonths<br>in Coleg Cambria and helps to show that I was the one who<br>
did the work and show what techniques I have used.</p>
<p>
I've had fun when making these it was something that I<br>usally enjoyed and 
coming up with ideas on how I would<br>make sometimes though my ideas are usally 
limited when<br>creating but though I have managed to get some things<img alt="halloween" height="183" src="images/halloweenposter.jpg" style="float: right" width="283"><br>
done I just like to be creative with my work and what I<br>include in it.<br></p>
<p>This evidence shows my classroom and my halloween poster<br>from lastyear 
which was something that we practice to do<br>making a poster for an 
advertisment or a promotion which<br>was something that was easy to do without 
and issue and<br>it was quite simple really.</p>
